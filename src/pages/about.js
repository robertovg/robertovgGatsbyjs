      I practice Ashtanga Yoga 3+ times per week, usually before working at 7:30 am, Ashtanga really
      changed the way I overcome the challenges and it makes my day, even before having properly
      started it.

      Another passion of mine is playing the guitar. I started to play this instrument in the
      conservatoire when I was ten years old, and continued to do so in a few rock bands until I
      began my university studies. Now, ten years later, I play in a jazz/funk band and I'm
      delighted to be back playing in a group.

      The province of Cadiz is renowned for its fantastic surf beaches, so last year I decided to
      give surfing a go. I try to get in the water every weekend and enjoy the progress I seem to be
      making.
