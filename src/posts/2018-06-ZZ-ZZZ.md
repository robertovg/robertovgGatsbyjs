This 2018, so far, has been the year for React Native --link (`RN`) for me, I've been focus on React --link for more than a year ago in Precursive --link and in my learning time, so when when I heard about React Native and how it was supposed to produce real native iOS and android applications reusing all my javaScripts toolset --links, it was an opportunity I don't wanted to miss.

Usually I use to put my hands in new technologies using official documentations and guides from official sources, but if I see a high quality courses, normally from [Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com), [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/), [Wes Boss](http://wesbos.com/), or like in this case [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.leveluptutorials.com), I just go for it. Basically because is the faster way I know to transfer the skills you need to use this technology to your brain, and completely processed for you to just get the right way of doing things.

I started with his [React Native For Everyone](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-native-for-everyone), it was very useful and I started to write pet applications just for fun and to explore the capacities of it. You really produce **real native applications** and multiplatform with just one code, that's genius!. But as they where just pet projects I never spent the right amount of time to make the projects set up correctly, well just a bit, but not everything.

Then he realise this [glorious course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react-native-with-graphql), this time like a continuation but adding graphql to it, and focusing on `graphcool` database (`graphql`--link with `apollo` --link). At that time I already had experience with `meteor` --link and `grahpql` so was a good way to improve on this stack also. Like always I do all the exercises are suggested and explained on courses, but with the output I knew, even when it was a great functional "Journal" application, I just wanted to complete the parts (as far I understood) where missing.

So what I did was to start with this `Level 2 React Native With Graphql` resulted project and iterate over it to incorporate the following improvements. I called it `Journal Updated` --link and published to github (where more and more I'm trying to have public code portfolio). All these points are also on the Readme of the project.

## Improvements to Journal

### add .eslint and right .babel

### Fixing lint problems (translating stateless components to pure function, adding PropTypes to props, avoiding duplicated code, removing unused import,refactoring components...) --> from `$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint ./components`

### Moving the graphcool url to a configurable property so we don't have to publish in the code. Resolved with `react-native-dotenv`

### If we update the title, we don't have it correctly updated, apparently it was cause by problems with [`goBack` issues with the 1.x react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/2454), they fixed with the new [react-navigation-2.0-rc](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2018/04/06/react-navigation-2.0-rc.html#breaking-changes), so updating and changing a bit the goBack to a navigate, do the work

### fix and align the loading

### fix some styles in smaller IPhone

### have the possibility of hiding the keyboard when clicking out of the Post textarea. Using `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` from `ScrollView`.

### Change color of indicators form IPhone ( network, time, etc)

### Fix the problem with `Nested React Native projects result in TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating self.fetch)` published in [react-native official github](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/9599)

### Using RN version of the presets for .babelrc to avoid problems with babel and polyfill and other weird errors

### Using expo `react-native` branch to avoid expo problem and updating libraries

### Adding icon and splash for the app from expo

## Pain problems with RN

Additional problems with RN.

* I found expo (exp start ) far slower and heavier to my computer than react-native-scripts
* Always try to test in real devices, because simulators also slow down a lot your computer, additionally, you don't have two load iOS / Android on your mac to try, but just
* The problem of https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/9599
* The problem of expo CDN slug
