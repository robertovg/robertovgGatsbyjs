## The initiative

This Monday (2020-01-20), listening to [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/215/hasty-treat-picking-the-stack-for-uses-tech-gatsby-react-context-styled-components) I hear about the [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) initiative, something I see more and more in developers profiles and I found very useful to get good ideas of tools people found in their daily work.

## Why I joined to the idea

I play the guitar since I was 10 years old, and in bands from the '00s, and I remember copying our favourites bands gears and configurations in a page called [Guitargeek](https://web.archive.org/web/20170420231024/https://www.guitar.com/) (no longer online) when I was finding my sound.

So when I saw the initiative created, I got in love with the idea to apply it to our tools as developers, and I found both `uses.tech` and each `/uses` pages super interesting to see what people are using and get improvement ideas.

## Here you have mine

So I created my [/uses](/uses/), adding not only "Hardware" but the pieces of software and technology I use daily and after years of usage, I found it worth to keep in my workflow.

Feel free to visit [it and hopefully get some ideas](/uses/)
